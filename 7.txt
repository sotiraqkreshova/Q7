I created a Maze class
The constructor Maze()
I get the maze from a text file "maze.txt" then store it in two 2D arrays.
I created a stack 'path'

The main logic is that we will keep trying moves until we win

If we get stucked we undo the last move and try the next valid move.. and so on.

If we are stucked and keep undoing until we are back to the start position then there is no way to solve this maze.

The maze is represented in "maze.txt" file as 
' ' = valid way
'*' = a Wall
'.' = current position / current path
'$' = the target point
